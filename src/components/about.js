            Go my Fund is an online crowdfunding platform developed specifically
            for Investor. Large crowdfunding sites contain campaigns for
            everything from new businesses to community projects to family
            emergencies, making it complicated and challenging for Investors to
            find their voice. If you are someone who wants to volunteer, study,
            intern, and make a difference abroad, we started Go my Fund with you
            in mind.
